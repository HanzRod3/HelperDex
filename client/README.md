HelperDex is a web application that allows users to explore Pokémon, select favorites, and compare type effectiveness in battles. It’s designed to offer a simple, interactive way for users to build their own Pokémon lists, view stats, and determine type advantages. This project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and integrates the PokéAPI for real-time Pokémon data.
